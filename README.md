Hi there ya'll :))

Plant lives matter

Seventy bottle of beer on the wall.

Pull requests, a coder's delight,  
A beacon shining in the night.  
From branch to branch, the changes flow,  
A tale of teamwork starts to grow.  

Lines of code, both old and new,  
Reviewed by peers with a careful view.  
Suggestions made, improvements sought,  
A masterpiece from what was wrought.  

Conflicts arise, but fear not the fray,  
For resolution paves the way.  
Merge the streams, unite the code,  
Together we lighten the load.  

A comment here, a note to share,  
Collaboration fills the air.  
Each pull request, a story told,  
Of innovation, brave and bold.  

Tests are run, the checks complete,  
Ensuring code is strong and neat.  
Green lights flash, the build is done,  
The journey ends, a victory won.  

With every merge, the project grows,  
A testament to what teamwork shows.  
Pull requests, a coder's art,  
Uniting minds, though miles apart.  

So raise a toast to this noble quest,  
For pull requests bring out our best.  
In every line, a dream takes flight,  
A coder's world, shining bright.

Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
