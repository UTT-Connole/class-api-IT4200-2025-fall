Hi there ya'll :))

Plant lives matter

Seventy bottle of beer on the wall.

Pull requests, a coder's delight,  
A beacon shining in the night.  
From branch to branch, the changes flow,  
A tale of teamwork starts to grow.  

Lines of code, both old and new,  
Reviewed by peers with a careful view.  
Suggestions made, improvements sought,  
A masterpiece from what was wrought.  

Conflicts arise, but fear not the fray,  
For resolution paves the way.  
Merge the streams, unite the code,  
Together we lighten the load.  

A comment here, a note to share,  
Collaboration fills the air.  
Each pull request, a story told,  
Of innovation, brave and bold.  

Tests are run, the checks complete,  
Ensuring code is strong and neat.  
Green lights flash, the build is done,  
The journey ends, a victory won.  

With every merge, the project grows,  
A testament to what teamwork shows.  
Pull requests, a coder's art,  
Uniting minds, though miles apart.  

So raise a toast to this noble quest,  
For pull requests bring out our best.  
In every line, a dream takes flight,  
A coder's world, shining bright.

Sandals, oh sandals, what a sight,  
With straps that pinch and soles too light.  
In summer's heat, they seem so grand,  
But blisters form, oh, isn't it bland?  

They flop and they flounder, a clumsy dance,  
With every step, they take a chance.  
A toe exposed, a heel laid bare,  
In the world of footwear, they’re hardly rare.  

Rainy days bring a soggy fate,  
As puddles splash, they hesitate.  
No arch support, no cozy embrace,  
In the realm of comfort, they lose the race.  

So here’s to shoes that hug the feet,  
With sturdy soles and a comfy seat.  
Sandals may shine in the summer sun,  
But give me real shoes, and I’ll have more fun!
