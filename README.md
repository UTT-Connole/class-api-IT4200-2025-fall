## Bulid as of latest commit by DaveTheFave is Runnable
Please be aware of the following problems that prevent running that needed to be fixed to run:
* Duplicate endpoints, either same name, or complete copied laying around after merge conflicts
* Duplicate function names, like `home()` has been used several times. This has been hotfixed with `home1(), home2()` and so forth. Recommend using unique function names.
* Otherwise normal python syntax errors. Remember CS1410 my dudes?

## Pokémon

Pokémon is a media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, first released by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures in 1996. The franchise centers around fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.

### Main Concepts

- **Pokémon**: Creatures with various abilities, types, and evolutions. There are currently over 1,000 unique Pokémon species.
- **Types**: Each Pokémon has one or two types (such as Water, Fire, Grass, Electric, Psychic, etc.), which determine strengths and weaknesses in battles.
- **Battles**: Trainers use their Pokémon to battle others, using moves and strategies based on type advantages.
- **Evolution**: Many Pokémon can evolve into more powerful forms, often by leveling up, using special items, or meeting certain conditions.

### Popular Pokémon

- **Pikachu**: The franchise mascot, an Electric-type Pokémon.
- **Charizard**: A powerful Fire/Flying-type, final evolution of Charmander.
- **Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander**: The original starter Pokémon from the first games.

### Games

The main series consists of role-playing games (RPGs) where players travel through regions, catch Pokémon, defeat Gym Leaders, and challenge the Pokémon League. Notable games include:
- Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow (Gen 1)
- Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal (Gen 2)
- Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald (Gen 3)
- Pokémon Sword/Shield (Gen 8)
- Pokémon Scarlet/Violet (Gen 9)

### Other Media

- **Anime**: Follows Ash Ketchum and his friends as they travel the world, catch Pokémon, and compete in tournaments.
- **Trading Card Game**: A collectible card game where players build decks and battle.
- **Movies, Manga, and Merchandise**: Pokémon has a vast array of movies, comics, toys, and other products.

### Fun Facts

- The name "Pokémon" is a contraction of "Pocket Monsters" (ポケットモンスター).
- The franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises in the world.
- "Gotta Catch 'Em All!" is the iconic slogan.

Seventy bottle of beer on the wall.

Pull requests, a coder's delight,  
A beacon shining in the night.  
From branch to branch, the changes flow,  
A tale of teamwork starts to grow.  

Lines of code, both old and new,  
Reviewed by peers with a careful view.  
Suggestions made, improvements sought,  
A masterpiece from what was wrought.  

Conflicts arise, but fear not the fray,  
For resolution paves the way.  
Merge the streams, unite the code,  
Together we lighten the load.  

A comment here, a note to share,  
Collaboration fills the air.  
Each pull request, a story told,  
Of innovation, brave and bold.  

Tests are run, the checks complete,  
Ensuring code is strong and neat.  
Green lights flash, the build is done,  
The journey ends, a victory won.  

With every merge, the project grows,  
A testament to what teamwork shows.  
Pull requests, a coder's art,  
Uniting minds, though miles apart.  

So raise a toast to this noble quest,  
For pull requests bring out our best.  
In every line, a dream takes flight,  
A coder's world, shining bright.

Sandals, oh sandals, what a sight,  
With straps that pinch and soles too light.  
In summer's heat, they seem so grand,  
But blisters form, oh, isn't it bland?  

They flop and they flounder, a clumsy dance,  
With every step, they take a chance.  
A toe exposed, a heel laid bare,  
In the world of footwear, they’re hardly rare.  

Rainy days bring a soggy fate,  
As puddles splash, they hesitate.  
No arch support, no cozy embrace,  
In the realm of comfort, they lose the race.  

## /campus-locations
Returns a random location on the Utah Tech Campus 


## /charger-facts
